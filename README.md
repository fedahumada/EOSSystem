# EOSSystem Project Overview

The EOSSystem project implements the Epic Online Services (EOS) subsystem to facilitate effective connectivity through a login registration system, which requires an Epic Games account. The primary objective of this project is to establish robust multiplayer sessions within the game. EOSSystem is not a standalone game but rather provides the foundational elements for creating lobbies and servers, including both listen servers and dedicated servers (See branches). 

This system can be applied to various projects beyond its current scope. Additionally, the project is supported by the creation of an organization on the Epic Games developer portal. Due to privacy reasons, the artifacts used in this project are not shared.
