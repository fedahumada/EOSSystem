# EOSSystem Project Overview

The EOSSystem project integrates the Epic Online Services (EOS) subsystem to enhance connectivity via a login registration system requiring an Epic Games account. Its main goal is to enable robust multiplayer sessions, providing the essential infrastructure for creating lobbies and servers, including both listen servers (Peer to Peer) and dedicated servers.

The repository also demonstrates how to integrate EOS dedicated servers with PlayFab. It includes the setup and management of these servers using PlayFab cloud services, which leverages autoscaling capabilities to maintain optimal performance and efficiency, irrespective of player load.

(See branches for diferent implementations and features)

The EOSSystem can be adapted for various projects and is supported through an organization on the Epic Games developer portal and a Playfab developer account.
